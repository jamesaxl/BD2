BD2(WIP)
===
BD2 is a fully distributed database designed from ground up with security and compatibility in mind.
It's been a hobby project for near a year and has a lot of week points and all kinds of obvious errors in it's current state.
I've released it in the github with the hope that it motivates me more than anyone else to spend more time on it.

More documentation will be added over time.
